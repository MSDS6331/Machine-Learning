# MSDS 6331: Machine Learning

**Practical machine learning in Python**

**Instructor**. Dimitri Yatsenko, Ph.D.

Monday 5.30 - 6.45 PM

An overview of the key concepts of machine learning through practical examples and applications. Programming projects will be used for learning techniques, for interpreting results and understanding scaling up from thousands of records to millions/billions

All assignments will be in Python 3.6 or newer with libraries for data analytics: 
* [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/)
* [`scipy`](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) 
* [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org)

By the end of the course, students will be expected to become skilled in applying these libraries to solving new problems.

Python has become a leading language for data analysis and machine learning thanks to the rich ecosystem of best-in-class open-source libraries developed by the community.
