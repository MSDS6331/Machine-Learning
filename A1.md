# Project 
Review this study from cognitive psychology: 
* Gauvrit et al, (2017) ["Human behavioral complexity peaks at age 25"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005408)
* [Dataset](https://github.com/algorithmicnaturelab/HumanBehavioralComplexity)

1. Reproduce the main finding in the paper that the ability to generate random sequencies peaks at age 25.
2. Design a binary classifier that uses the performance on these cognitive tasks to tell whether the person is in age category 1: 15-65 yo or category 2: all other ages.
3. Plot the ROC for the classifier.
